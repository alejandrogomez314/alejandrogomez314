<h3>Hello! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<h3>Iâ€™m Alejandro, a software engineer, investor, writer, athlete and lover of the arts.</h3>

I like to find out how and why things work by using First Principles and observation. I've done a little bit of everything in programming, but now focus on systems and how we can make them more secure and resilient. 

Here you'll find some of the code projects I've worked on and others that I'm still working on.
