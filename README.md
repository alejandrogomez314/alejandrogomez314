<h3>Hello! 👋</h3>
<h3>I’m Alejandro, a software engineer, investor, writer, athlete and lover of the arts.</h3>

I like to find out how and why things work by using First Principles and observation. I've done a little bit of everything in programming, but now focus on systems and how we can make them more secure and resilient. Recently, I've set out to understand and build from scratch the basic building blocks of computing, from instruction sets 𝟎𝟎𝟏𝟎, to operating systems 💻 to distributed system design ☸️.

Here you'll find some of the code projects I've worked on and others that I'm still working on.

Here are a few quotes by Alan Kay (creator of OOP, the GUI and the tablet) that will smarten your day!

> "Technology is anything that didn't exist after you were born."

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."

> "The television should be the last media device put out there without an inspector general's warning."
